# COVID-19-Analysis-using-Deep-learning-models
The virus named 2019 Novel Corona virus (2019-nCoV) that belongs to the group of RNA viruses family ‘Corona Virus’ has been recognized as the cause of a worldwide pandemic of respiratory illness. It originated from the food market of Wuhan, China and now has been perceived as worldwide pandemic. As the outbreak advanced, the epidemiological information is required to guide the process of strategies required to fight the disease and to provide suitable awareness.  In this chapter we are proposing statistical analysis of growth with respect to both number of cases and recoveries overtime along with clustering of countries that have similar mortality and recovery rates. Also, we aim in developing forecasting models based on Artificial intelligence and Machine learning algorithms to determine the risk of contracting the virus. For the predictions and forecasting, we will be making use of several machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Linear regression, Polynomial Regression, Holt’s model and AR model  and MA model using auto ARIMA, etc.
